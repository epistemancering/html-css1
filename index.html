            In this lab exercise, I created this page using HTML & CSS. There was nothing to download as I started from scratch.

            </a>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I decided what I wanted to make my page about - it could have been about a hobby, a book, a movie, an event, a place, or anything else I could think of
                </li>
                <li>
                    I sketched out a basic layout (I could have done this anywhere, I won't be submitting it)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I created a folder for my project, inside the folder, I created an <a>index.html</a> file and a <a>styles.css</a> file
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the HTML file, I set up my basic structure - doctype, head, body
                </li>
                <li>
                    I started coding! The LMS recommended breaking down my sketch into small parts. I did all of the HTML and then all of the CSS before moving on to the next part. I didn't worry if my code was messy or repetitive right then - I was learning!
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br>
            <br>
            Once I created my basic page, I did some HTML & CSS research and saw what I could add! We'll cover classes & ids, the position, display, & flexbox properties, as well as semantic HTML later in this unit; so I used my time in this lab to look at other topics. <a href = 'https://www.w3schools.com/html/'>W3Schools</a> and <a href = 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/'>MDN</a> are both great reference sites for HTML & CSS.

                    When I was done, I created a repo on GitHub and pushed up my code.
